   <b> Hi, I&apos;m Noorul Ameen! </b><br></br>
     I am a Bachelor's student in Computer Science with a strong passion for technology and innovation. My skills include programming, working with AI, and solving problems using new technologies. Iâ€™ve also dabbled in graphic design, making cool flyers and content at a local restaurant using Canva. I have gained valuable experience as an AI Trainer at Outlier and as a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI, where I developed my technical and leadership skills.
